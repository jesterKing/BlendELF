INSTALL

---------------------------------------------------------
------------------------- LINUX -------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------

On linux you need to install the following libraries:

GLFW (http://glfw.sourceforge.net)
GLEW (http://glew.sourceforge.net)
Freeimage (http://freeimage.sourceforge.net)
FreeType (http://www.freetype.org)
OpenAL (http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal)
Ogg Vorbis (http://www.vorbis.com)
lua (http://www.lua.org)
Bullet Physics (http://bulletphysics.com)
enet (http://enet.bespin.org/)
Assimp (http://assimp.sourceforge.net/)

The chances are that you already have some of them. Most
of them can be installed from the package repositories.
Bullet Physics and enet aren't present in many repos, so
you'll have to compile and install them manually. For
enet, the procedure should be just:

./configure && make && make install

For Bullet, you'll have to gerate the makefiles first
with something like cmake, and then do:

make && make install

If you are using cmake to generate bullet makefiles,
the version 2.76 version of bullet doesn't generate
the installation script with cmake unless you supply
it with a flag:

cmake . -G "Unix Makefiles" -DINSTALL_LIBS=ON

Cmake is the primary build system for Assimp too. Use
the following command to configure, compile and install
Assimp:

cmake . && make && make install

After you got all of the libraries installed, just
type the following command and blendelf should compile:

make

If you want to make a release build of blendelf, or a
shared library release build of blender, use the following
commands:

(for static release): make static
(for shared release): make shared

First you need to compile Bullet Physics and GLFW

Download from Bullet Physics from:

http://code.google.com/p/bullet/downloads/list

Extract and generate XCode project with:

cmake . -G Xcode

Then build it using XCode.

For GLFW, check out the glfw svn:

svn co https://glfw.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/glfw glfw

Compile with:

make cocoa

Install the other dependencies with macports or following
the install instructions of the individual libraries.

sudo port install lua
sudo port install vorbis
sudo port install glew
sudo port install freeimage
...

Compile the BlendELF code with:

make -f Makefile.osx
